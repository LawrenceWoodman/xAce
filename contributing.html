<h3>The xAce wiki</h3>
The <a href="http://wiki.github.com/LawrenceWoodman/xAce">xAce wiki</a> is on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> and the <a href="http://wiki.github.com/LawrenceWoodman/xAce/todo-list">Todo List</a> should be particularly helpful to see what work is intended.<br />

<ul>
	<li>Programmers</li>
	<li>Testers</li>
