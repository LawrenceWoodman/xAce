<h2>Contact</h2>

If you would like to contribute, it would be great to hear from you. The best place to get in touch would be via the <a href="http://www.freelists.org/list/xace-dev">xAce Development Mailing List</a>.<br />
<br />
You may also find the <a href="http://github.com/LawrenceWoodman/xAce/commits/master.atom">Commit History Feed</a> useful, particularly if you are not using Git or GitHub to manage your source.


<h2>Project Direction</h2>

It is still early days and as more people join the project, things will become more concrete. For now I have created a <a href="http://wiki.github.com/LawrenceWoodman/xAce/todo-list">Todo List</a> on the <a href="http://wiki.github.com/LawrenceWoodman/xAce">xAce wiki</a> that details some of the current intentions. The first new release planned, is a minor one that ensures that xAce supports 32bpp displays and should be released as v0.4.1

<h2>The xAce Wiki</h2>

As mentioned above there is an <a href="http://wiki.github.com/LawrenceWoodman/xAce">xAce wiki</a>, it is quite small at the moment but will continue to develop.&nbsp; The <a href="http://wiki.github.com/LawrenceWoodman/xAce/contributing">Contributing</a> page should be particularly helpful as well as the <a href="http://wiki.github.com/LawrenceWoodman/xAce/todo-list">Todo List</a> to see what work is intended.<br />

<h2>What we Need</h2>

Currently the project is in need of:<br />
<ul>
	<li>Programmers</li>
	<li>Testers</li>
	<li>A web designer to improve the project page</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to do now</h2>

You can either fork the <a href="http://github.com/LawrenceWoodman/xAce">xAce repository</a> on GitHub, or download the latest <a href="http://github.com/LawrenceWoodman/xAce/archives/master">master branch source code</a>, whichever you find more comfortable. I would however, encourage anyone interested, to take the time to give Git and GitHub a go as it makes life so much easier.
