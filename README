Compilation:
	If you have 'xmkmf'? Run it first and then 'make' xace.

	If you don't have 'xmkmf' then try just to run 'make' with
	'-f makefile.org' and hope for the best!
	I haven't done any bigger efforts to make it compile for a
	lot of platforms. But its short and should be easy to
	adapt for different platforms.

	If it compiles try running 'xace' and you're off. (I hope)

The ROM?
	The distribution includes a copy of the Jupiter ACE ROM image. 
	AFAIK there are no problems with this - I do not have a clue 
	who bought the remains of Boldfield Computing when they went 
	broke. (I can't find any trace of their existence) 

Version:
	v0.4 third distribution. *can now also run on 16 bit display.

	The emulator is up and running. I've added some loading and
	save capabilities. There is still no sound implemented yet. 
	Now tested on SGI, FreeBSD, Linux and SunOS platforms.

Description:
	This emulator is made by me, Edward Patel. The Jupiter ACE 
	is the real *outsider* micro from the 80's. Instead of having
	BASIC as the programming language it had FORTH. It was designed
	by two guys how had worked at Sinclair Research Ltd and was
	responsible for the famous Sinclair ZX81 and ZX Spectrum. 
	They are Steven Vickers and Richard Altwasser.
	For a FAQ (1999) see http://users.aol.com/autismuk/ace/faq.htm

	I made it for the fun of it. As a base I used Russell Marks
	ZX81 emulator xz81. Which he based on Ian Collier xz80, a 
	ZX Spectrum emulator for X. The xz81 can be found (1997) at
	ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/system/emulators/zx/z81-0.2.tar.gz

Others:
	Paul Robson (autismuk@aol.com) has made a DOS version and is also
	the maintainer of the FAQ mentioned earlier.
