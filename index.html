<h2>What is xAce?</h2>
xAce is an emulator for the Jupiter Ace that runs under most flavours of Unix.&nbsp; It 
was written by Edward Patel and based on a ZX81 emulator called <em>xz81</em> written by 
Russell Marks, which was in turn based on Ian Collier&#039;s <em>xz80</em>, a ZX Spectrum
emulator for X.
