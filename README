	The Jupiter ACE is the real *outsider* micro from the 80's. 
	Instead of having BASIC as the programming language it had FORTH. 
	It was designed by two guys how had worked at Sinclair Research Ltd 
	and was responsible for the famous Sinclair ZX81 and ZX Spectrum. 
	They are Steven Vickers and Richard Altwasser.
	For a FAQ (2010) see
	http://www.robsons.org.uk/archive/users.aol.com/autismuk/ace/faq.htm

	I made it for the fun of it. As a base I used Russell Marks
	ZX81 emulator xz81. Which he based on Ian Collier xz80, a 
	ZX Spectrum emulator for X. The xz81 can be found (2010) at 
	http://www.zx81.nl/dload/emulators/unix/z81-0.2.tar.gz

The project has been revived at github by http://github.com/LawrenceWoodman

I have updated a couple of broken references.

I can recommend downloading a copy of "Thinking Forth"

Compilation:
	If you have 'xmkmf'? Run it first and then 'make' xace.

	If you don't have 'xmkmf' then try just to run 'make' with
	'-f makefile.org' and hope for the best!
	I haven't done any bigger efforts to make it compile for a
	lot of platforms. But its short and should be easy to
	adapt for different platforms.

	If it compiles try running 'xace' and you're off. (I hope)

The ROM?
	The distribution includes a copy of the Jupiter ACE ROM image. 
	Please see boldcomp.email.txt file included for more information.

Version:
	v0.4.1	See CHANGELOG.md for details of changes.

	The emulator is up and running. I've added some loading and
	save capabilities. There is still no sound implemented yet. 
	Now tested on SGI, FreeBSD, Linux and SunOS platforms.
	
Loading/Saving External Files
	External files are accessed from the current directory.
	Please note that xAce now only uses the '.tap' file extension for
	loading	and saving files, so older '.byt' and '.dic' files will
	need renaming.

Software for the Jupiter Ace
	The Jupiter Ace Resource Site (http://www.jupiter-ace.co.uk) is
	the best source for Ace	software.  Download 'TAP files' to work with
	xAce and rename the .TAP files so that they are in lower-case.

Others:
	Paul Robson (old email removed) has made a DOS version and is also
	the maintainer of the FAQ mentioned earlier.
