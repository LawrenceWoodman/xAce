	The Jupiter ACE is the real *outsider* micro from the 80's. 
	Instead of having BASIC as the programming language it had FORTH. 
	It was designed by two guys who had worked at Sinclair Research Ltd
	and were responsible for the famous Sinclair ZX81 and ZX Spectrum.
	They are Steven Vickers and Richard Altwasser.
	For a FAQ (2010) see
	http://www.robsons.org.uk/archive/users.aol.com/autismuk/ace/faq.htm

	I made it for the fun of it. As a base I used Russell Marks
	ZX81 emulator xz81. Which he based on Ian Collier xz80, a 
	ZX Spectrum emulator for X. The xz81 can be found (2010) at 
	http://www.zx81.nl/dload/emulators/unix/z81-0.2.tar.gz

The project has been revived at github by http://github.com/LawrenceWoodman

I have updated a couple of broken references.

I can recommend downloading a copy of "Thinking Forth"

	src/                - Contains the source code for xAce
	tests/              - Contains testing routines

Requirements:
	xAce will run on a variety of Unix platforms and has been tested
	most thoroughly on Linux.

	To compile it you will need to have the following development
	libraries installed:
		libx11   (Often packaged as libx11-dev)
		libxext  (Often packaged as libxext-dev)

	In addition the build process uses 'CMake', which you will have to have
	installed on your system.

Compilation and Installation:
	From the root directory of the repository, i.e. The directory this file
	is in.  Run 'cmake' to create the Makefiles:
		cmake .

	Now run 'make' from the same directory:
		make

	The binary executable will now be in src/, to install it to a sensible
	location such as '/usr/local/bin' run the following as root:
		make install

	For the moment xAce must be run from a terminal window and from the
	same directory in which the rom image is to be found.  So from the
	current directory run:
		xace


The ROM?
	The distribution includes a copy of the Jupiter ACE ROM image. 
	Please see boldcomp.email.txt file included for more information.

Version:
	v0.4.1	See CHANGELOG.md for details of changes.
	
Loading/Saving External Files:
	To attach a tape press 'F3' and enter the name of the tape
	file that you wish to use.  From this point any loading or
	saving is done to this file.

	It is important to note that when you save, the rest of the
	file is truncated.

Spooling:
	To spool text into xAce from an external file, press 'F11'
	and enter the name of the file that you want xAce to read.
	Alternatively you can use the -s command line switch e.g.
		./xace -s spool.file

Software for the Jupiter Ace:
	The Jupiter Ace Resource Site (http://www.jupiter-ace.co.uk) is
	the best source for Ace	software.  Here you will find that most
	of the .TAP files should work.

	The xAce project page (http://lawrencewoodman.github.com/xAce/)

	Paul Robson (old email removed) has made a DOS version and is also
	the maintainer of the FAQ mentioned earlier.
