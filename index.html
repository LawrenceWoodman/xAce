<h2>What is xAce?</h2>
xAce is an emulator for the Jupiter Ace that runs under most flavours of
Unix. It was written by Edward Patel and based on a ZX81 emulator called
<em>xz81</em> written by Russell Marks, which was in turn based on
Ian Collier&#039;s <em>xz80</em>, a ZX Spectrum emulator for X.

<h2>Compiling</h2>
First download and extract the source code from:
<a href="https://github.com/LawrenceWoodman/xAce/archive/v0.5.zip">GitHub</a>.<br />
From the root directory of the repository. Create the Makefiles:<br />
  <code>$ cmake .</code><br />
<br />
Now run 'make' from the same directory:<br />
  <code>$ make</code><br />
<br />
The binary executable will now be in <code>src/</code>, to install it to a
sensible location such as <code>/usr/local/bin</code> run the following
as root:<br />
  <code>$ make install</code></br>
<br />
For the moment xAce must be run from a terminal window and from the
same directory in which the rom image is to be found.  So from the
current directory run:<br />
  <code>./xace</code><br />
<br />
